/**
 * What is the dispatch method used for?
 * How do we use redux thunk in order to use "async (dispatch)" Asynchrony in React-Redux is often done via a thunk. This thunk function is middleware that unlocks async operations by deferring execution. 
 * 
 * * In this take, weâ€™ll dive into what happens when there is more than a single async request. 
 * Async code is unpredictable because completion is not known ahead of time and multiple requests complicate things.
